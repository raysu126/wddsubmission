							<p> From this article, I learned about the importance of choosing the right typography for a design project and how it can significantly affect the project's overall impact and effectiveness. It highlighted the need to consider the purpose of the design and the target audience when selecting fonts, as different demographics may respond better to different typefaces. Additionally, the article provided practical advice on seeking inspiration, choosing fonts, pairing them effectively, and using tools to determine the best font sizes. </p>

							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about the process of choosing and pairing fonts. The idea that combining different fonts can guide a reader's eye and establish visual hierarchy within a design really stood out to me. This part made me think more critically about how font choices can influence the overall effectiveness and aesthetic appeal of a design, beyond just the individual beauty of a typeface.
