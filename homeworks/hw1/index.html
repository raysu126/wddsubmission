                        Something I learned from this article is the importance of actively studying apps to improve design skills. By dissecting elements such as hierarchy, content, intent, and audience, one can gain a deeper understanding of effective design principles and how they contribute to a positive user experience.

                        My favorite part of this article is the practical advice given on how to analyze apps effectively. Breaking down popular apps like Airbnb, Twitter, and Spotify provides concrete examples for readers to apply when studying other products, making the concept more tangible and actionable.

                        A compelling quote from the article is: "Know the rules, so you can break em." This encapsulates the idea that understanding fundamental design principles is crucial for innovation and creativity in design.

                        I would rate my enjoyment of reading this article as an 8 out of 10. It's easy to read and does provide many useful insight for design beginners.
