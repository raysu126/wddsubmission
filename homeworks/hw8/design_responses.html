						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> 
							From this article, I learned about the various types of dark patterns used in UX/UI design to manipulate users into taking actions they may not intend to. It was eye-opening to see how these patterns are employed across different platforms, from subscription-based websites to social media networks. Understanding these tactics can help users navigate the digital landscape more cautiously. </p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the section that discussed the big picture impact of dark patterns and possible solutions to address them. It's important to highlight the ethical implications of designing deceptive user interfaces and emphasize the need for transparency and responsibility in UX/UI design practices. </p>

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> When you use the web, you don’t read every word on every page — you skim read and make assumptions. If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another. You can defend yourself against dark patterns on this site. </p>
