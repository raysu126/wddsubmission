						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								From the article, I learned about Gestalt principles and their significance in UI design. These principles, such as proximity, similarity, and closure, elucidate how people perceive visual elements and can be applied to create cohesive and effective user interfaces. By leveraging Gestalt principles, designers can organize content, guide user attention, and enhance the overall user experience, ultimately contributing to successful communication and usability in UI design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favourite part is how the article relate proximity to UI design. I am familiar with the term proximity and the design rule that we should put similar things together, but I didn't realize before I read this article that it is because of proximity. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
