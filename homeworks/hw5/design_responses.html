                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> What I have learned is that adding animations to the interfaces could be eye catching. Most of the animations nicely present the result of users action, which add accessibility to users that have poor vision. However, sometimes I feel like the animation is sort of redundant design which actually distract people from the product itself. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> The way how some of the products fit their animation together with their design. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite is Travel Map by Never-stop for Radio Design. It's animation fuse well with its flow. It properly guides users through every step of their action. It emphasizes every decision user makes and lets it hang over there for a while to increase attention to them. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 5. Only part of the case is useful and others are just okay regards to the animation but not its contribution to overall design. </p>
